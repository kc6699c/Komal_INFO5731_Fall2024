"5.0 out of 5 stars
Sensitive body wash for my twins",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The pump dispenser is a nice touch, making it convenient to use in the shower without the hassle of flipping open a cap. A small amount goes a long way, and it spreads smoothly across the body without feeling heavy or greasy. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for my twins because they are sensitive to perfumes in some skincare products. It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable. I would highly recommend the Dove Hypoallergenic Sensitive Body Wash to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing cleanser that’s safe for sensitive skin types.

Great shower wash, not great for bubble bath, unscented but NOT fragrance free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this product for years. It’s great for dry skin or eczema.It may not eliminate the need for body lotion after your shower, but it is much milder than most liquid body soaps. It’s a great, affordable sulfate/paraben-free option.A few notes:1) It is “unscented” but not “fragrance free.” There is a very light fragrance added to mask the scent of the other ingredients. It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn’t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain’t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won’t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

Sensitive body wash for my twins",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The pump dispenser is a nice touch, making it convenient to use in the shower without the hassle of flipping open a cap. A small amount goes a long way, and it spreads smoothly across the body without feeling heavy or greasy. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for my twins because they are sensitive to perfumes in some skincare products. It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable. I would highly recommend the Dove Hypoallergenic Sensitive Body Wash to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing cleanser that’s safe for sensitive skin types.

Great shower wash, not great for bubble bath, unscented but NOT fragrance free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this product for years. It’s great for dry skin or eczema.It may not eliminate the need for body lotion after your shower, but it is much milder than most liquid body soaps. It’s a great, affordable sulfate/paraben-free option.A few notes:1) It is “unscented” but not “fragrance free.” There is a very light fragrance added to mask the scent of the other ingredients. It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn’t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain’t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won’t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

Sensitive body wash for my twins",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The pump dispenser is a nice touch, making it convenient to use in the shower without the hassle of flipping open a cap. A small amount goes a long way, and it spreads smoothly across the body without feeling heavy or greasy. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for my twins because they are sensitive to perfumes in some skincare products. It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable. I would highly recommend the Dove Hypoallergenic Sensitive Body Wash to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing cleanser that’s safe for sensitive skin types.

Great shower wash, not great for bubble bath, unscented but NOT fragrance free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this product for years. It’s great for dry skin or eczema.It may not eliminate the need for body lotion after your shower, but it is much milder than most liquid body soaps. It’s a great, affordable sulfate/paraben-free option.A few notes:1) It is “unscented” but not “fragrance free.” There is a very light fragrance added to mask the scent of the other ingredients. It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn’t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain’t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won’t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn’t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain’t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won’t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

Sensitive body wash for my twins",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The pump dispenser is a nice touch, making it convenient to use in the shower without the hassle of flipping open a cap. A small amount goes a long way, and it spreads smoothly across the body without feeling heavy or greasy. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for my twins because they are sensitive to perfumes in some skincare products. It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable. I would highly recommend the Dove Hypoallergenic Sensitive Body Wash to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing cleanser that’s safe for sensitive skin types.

Great shower wash, not great for bubble bath, unscented but NOT fragrance free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this product for years. It’s great for dry skin or eczema.It may not eliminate the need for body lotion after your shower, but it is much milder than most liquid body soaps. It’s a great, affordable sulfate/paraben-free option.A few notes:1) It is “unscented” but not “fragrance free.” There is a very light fragrance added to mask the scent of the other ingredients. It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn’t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain’t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won’t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

Sensitive body wash for my twins",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The pump dispenser is a nice touch, making it convenient to use in the shower without the hassle of flipping open a cap. A small amount goes a long way, and it spreads smoothly across the body without feeling heavy or greasy.

It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable.

Sensitive body wash for my twins",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The pump dispenser is a nice touch, making it convenient to use in the shower without the hassle of flipping open a cap. A small amount goes a long way, and it spreads smoothly across the body without feeling heavy or greasy. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for my twins because they are sensitive to perfumes in some skincare products. It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable. I would highly recommend the Dove Hypoallergenic Sensitive Body Wash to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing cleanser that’s safe for sensitive skin types.

Great shower wash, not great for bubble bath, unscented but NOT fragrance free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this product for years. It’s great for dry skin or eczema.It may not eliminate the need for body lotion after your shower, but it is much milder than most liquid body soaps. It’s a great, affordable sulfate/paraben-free option.A few notes:1) It is “unscented” but not “fragrance free.” There is a very light fragrance added to mask the scent of the other ingredients. It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn’t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain’t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won’t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

Sensitive body wash for my twins",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The pump dispenser is a nice touch, making it convenient to use in the shower without the hassle of flipping open a cap. A small amount goes a long way, and it spreads smoothly across the body without feeling heavy or greasy. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for my twins because they are sensitive to perfumes in some skincare products. It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable. I would highly recommend the Dove Hypoallergenic Sensitive Body Wash to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing cleanser that’s safe for sensitive skin types.

Great shower wash, not great for bubble bath, unscented but NOT fragrance free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this product for years. It’s great for dry skin or eczema.It may not eliminate the need for body lotion after your shower, but it is much milder than most liquid body soaps. It’s a great, affordable sulfate/paraben-free option.A few notes:1) It is “unscented” but not “fragrance free.” There is a very light fragrance added to mask the scent of the other ingredients. It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn’t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain’t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won’t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

Sensitive body wash for my twins",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The pump dispenser is a nice touch, making it convenient to use in the shower without the hassle of flipping open a cap. A small amount goes a long way, and it spreads smoothly across the body without feeling heavy or greasy. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for my twins because they are sensitive to perfumes in some skincare products. It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable. I would highly recommend the Dove Hypoallergenic Sensitive Body Wash to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing cleanser that’s safe for sensitive skin types.

Great shower wash, not great for bubble bath, unscented but NOT fragrance free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this product for years. It’s great for dry skin or eczema.It may not eliminate the need for body lotion after your shower, but it is much milder than most liquid body soaps. It’s a great, affordable sulfate/paraben-free option.A few notes:1) It is “unscented” but not “fragrance free.” There is a very light fragrance added to mask the scent of the other ingredients. It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn’t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain’t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won’t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

Sensitive body wash for my twins",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The pump dispenser is a nice touch, making it convenient to use in the shower without the hassle of flipping open a cap. A small amount goes a long way, and it spreads smoothly across the body without feeling heavy or greasy. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for my twins because they are sensitive to perfumes in some skincare products. It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable. I would highly recommend the Dove Hypoallergenic Sensitive Body Wash to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing cleanser that’s safe for sensitive skin types.

It’s also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for my twins because they are sensitive to perfumes in some skincare products. It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable. I would highly recommend the Dove Hypoallergenic Sensitive Body Wash to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing cleanser that’s safe for sensitive skin types.

Great shower wash, not great for bubble bath, unscented but NOT fragrance free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this product for years. It’s great for dry skin or eczema.It may not eliminate the need for body lotion after your shower, but it is much milder than most liquid body soaps. It’s a great, affordable sulfate/paraben-free option.A few notes:1) It is “unscented” but not “fragrance free.” There is a very light fragrance added to mask the scent of the other ingredients. It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn’t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain’t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won’t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

Sensitive body wash for my twins",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The pump dispenser is a nice touch, making it convenient to use in the shower without the hassle of flipping open a cap. A small amount goes a long way, and it spreads smoothly across the body without feeling heavy or greasy. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a big plus for my twins because they are sensitive to perfumes in some skincare products. It provides a thorough cleanse while leaving the skin feeling nourished and comfortable. I would highly recommend the Dove Hypoallergenic Sensitive Body Wash to anyone looking for a gentle, moisturizing cleanser that’s safe for sensitive skin types.

Great shower wash, not great for bubble bath, unscented but NOT fragrance free",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been using this product for years. It’s great for dry skin or eczema.It may not eliminate the need for body lotion after your shower, but it is much milder than most liquid body soaps. It’s a great, affordable sulfate/paraben-free option.A few notes:1) It is “unscented” but not “fragrance free.” There is a very light fragrance added to mask the scent of the other ingredients. It smells pleasantly neutral & doesn’t linger. But if you truly need fragrance free products for allergy reasons, this ain’t it.2) It does not lather as well as other body washes, due to added moisturizers and lack of sulfates. It will still leave you feeling clean and fresh.3) Do not try to use it as a bubble bath. It won’t make bubbles at all. I still take baths with it, but I find that I have to first dispense it into a dish and swish it together with a little water before adding it to the bath. Otherwise “chunks” of product float in the water and it’s gross.

Dove is Good, but EVIL GOODS is Amazing",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dove Body Wash with Pump  caught my attention as a reliable way to take care of my skin. It's a solid choice, especially for someone looking for a hypoallergenic, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and cruelty-free moisturizing cleanser. The convenience factor is great – just pump out a bit and you’re set for a refreshing, nourishing wash.However, after trying EVIL GOODS Whipped Beef Tallow and Honey Balm, I realized it aligned more closely with my lifestyle and skin care needs. EVIL GOODS not only provides the deep hydration I crave but also supports overall skin health with its unique blend of ingredients. This is significant for me. The inclusion of honey adds an extra layer of moisture and healing properties that make a noticeable difference. Plus, the grass-fed, grass-finished beef tallow feels richer and more luxurious, providing a deeper level of nourishment that lasts throughout the day. I got EVIL GOODS on Amazon too for anyone wondering: 
The experience of using evil goods also feels more tailored to an adult's needs. It's not just about moisturizing; it's about enhancing skin health in a way that aligns with my overall wellness goals. While Dove is great for providing basic hydration, EVIL GOODS feels like it's doing more for my skin.Dove  definitely has its perks. It's a fantastic choice for those looking for a straightforward, gentle cleanser without any added fragrances or harsh chemicals. The hypoallergenic formula is particularly beneficial for those with sensitive skin, offering a soothing and effective way to cleanse and nourish the skin. It’s also great for people who prefer a minimalist skincare routine. The convenience of this body wash, with its easy-to-use pump, can't be overstated – it’s perfect for quick and hassle-free use.

This DOVE skin product does not disappoint",4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a creamy, moisturizing, gently scented soap that doesn’t leave a heavy residue on the skin or the shower walls/floor/doors. The larger bottle size is helpful, however I couldn’t rate this product 5 stars because it’s a bit difficult to get the last 1 1/2” of soap out of the bottle. The pump feature doesn’t give the consumer the ability to just tip the bottle upside down to use the remaining amount of soap. I will continue to use this product.

Dove is Good, but EVIL GOODS is Amazing",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dove Body Wash with Pump  caught my attention as a reliable way to take care of my skin. It's a solid choice, especially for someone looking for a hypoallergenic, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and cruelty-free moisturizing cleanser. The convenience factor is great – just pump out a bit and you’re set for a refreshing, nourishing wash.However, after trying EVIL GOODS Whipped Beef Tallow and Honey Balm, I realized it aligned more closely with my lifestyle and skin care needs. EVIL GOODS not only provides the deep hydration I crave but also supports overall skin health with its unique blend of ingredients. This is significant for me.

This DOVE skin product does not disappoint",4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a creamy, moisturizing, gently scented soap that doesn’t leave a heavy residue on the skin or the shower walls/floor/doors. The larger bottle size is helpful, however I couldn’t rate this product 5 stars because it’s a bit difficult to get the last 1 1/2” of soap out of the bottle.

This DOVE skin product does not disappoint",4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a creamy, moisturizing, gently scented soap that doesn’t leave a heavy residue on the skin or the shower walls/floor/doors. The larger bottle size is helpful, however I couldn’t rate this product 5 stars because it’s a bit difficult to get the last 1 1/2” of soap out of the bottle. The pump feature doesn’t give the consumer the ability to just tip the bottle upside down to use the remaining amount of soap. I will continue to use this product.

Great deal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I normally buy this body wash and have been using it for years. My skin is pretty sensitive, and this works for me. It lathers well, smells nice, and leaves my skin feeling soft. I always buy the larger size because it is the best price per ounce. Over the years, like everything else, the price has increased. I got three of these on a Prime Day deal and was so happy I did because it was a fraction of the cost! I am very happy and will be looking out for these on the next Prime Day.

Great deal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I normally buy this body wash and have been using it for years. My skin is pretty sensitive, and this works for me. It lathers well, smells nice, and leaves my skin feeling soft. I always buy the larger size because it is the best price per ounce. Over the years, like everything else, the price has increased. I got three of these on a Prime Day deal and was so happy I did because it was a fraction of the cost! I am very happy and will be looking out for these on the next Prime Day.

Dove is Good, but EVIL GOODS is Amazing",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Dove Body Wash with Pump  caught my attention as a reliable way to take care of my skin. It's a solid choice, especially for someone looking for a hypoallergenic, paraben-free, sulfate-free, and cruelty-free moisturizing cleanser. The convenience factor is great – just pump out a bit and you’re set for a refreshing, nourishing wash.However, after trying EVIL GOODS Whipped Beef Tallow and Honey Balm, I realized it aligned more closely with my lifestyle and skin care needs. EVIL GOODS not only provides the deep hydration I crave but also supports overall skin health with its unique blend of ingredients. This is significant for me. The inclusion of honey adds an extra layer of moisture and healing properties that make a noticeable difference. Plus, the grass-fed, grass-finished beef tallow feels richer and more luxurious, providing a deeper level of nourishment that lasts throughout the day. I got EVIL GOODS on Amazon too for anyone wondering: 
The experience of using evil goods also feels more tailored to an adult's needs. It's not just about moisturizing; it's about enhancing skin health in a way that aligns with my overall wellness goals. While Dove is great for providing basic hydration, EVIL GOODS feels like it's doing more for my skin.Dove  definitely has its perks. It's a fantastic choice for those looking for a straightforward, gentle cleanser without any added fragrances or harsh chemicals. The hypoallergenic formula is particularly beneficial for those with sensitive skin, offering a soothing and effective way to cleanse and nourish the skin. It’s also great for people who prefer a minimalist skincare routine. The convenience of this body wash, with its easy-to-use pump, can't be overstated – it’s perfect for quick and hassle-free use. Plus, being paraben-free, sulfate-free, and cruelty-free, it offers a healthier option for those who want to avoid synthetic ingredients and support ethical products.While Dove Body Wash is a convenient and effective way to hydrate and cleanse your skin, for someone like me who’s looking for that extra edge in terms of skin health and overall wellness, the EVIL GOODS  Balm is the way to go. It offers a comprehensive approach to skincare, specifically geared towards enhancing and maintaining healthy skin with natural, high-quality ingredients, and that’s something I truly value. If you want to take your skincare to the next level and experience amazing results, EVIL GOODS is definitely worth the investment.

This DOVE skin product does not disappoint",4.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a creamy, moisturizing, gently scented soap that doesn’t leave a heavy residue on the skin or the shower walls/floor/doors. The larger bottle size is helpful, however I couldn’t rate this product 5 stars because it’s a bit difficult to get the last 1 1/2” of soap out of the bottle. The pump feature doesn’t give the consumer the ability to just tip the bottle upside down to use the remaining amount of soap. I will continue to use this product.
